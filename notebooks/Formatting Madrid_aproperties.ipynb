       "Villa for sale in San Lorenzo de El Escorial.  San Lorenzo de El Escorial                    VILLA WITH GARDEN ON A PLOT OF MORE THAN 3,000 METERS IN SAN LORENZO DE EL ESCORIAL.\\n\\nA beautiful villa in a privileged environment, built in 1940, transmits all the spirit of Herrerian architecture, a solid structure where granite and slate are signs of identity, giving shape to a rectangular building, sober in its lines, and topped with a characteristic tower that integrates the whole in this majestic environment. This house is divided into three floors. On the first floor there is a large kitchen, a bathroom, a dining room and a living room with fireplace. From the hall we access the upper floor where we find four bedrooms and two bathrooms. From here we go up to the second floor which is where we find the room that makes up the tower and which was originally a library-office. Another auxiliary attic room completes this floor. The house has many of the original materials, such as the handmade hydraulic tile floors, and requires a reform in which many elements are updated. However, in 2008 the entire electrical and plumbing installation was completely replaced. The house has an elevator and ramp for easy access if necessary, and the structure, roof and enclosures are in good condition. The front garden, facing south, had in its fullness with gardens sculpted in boxwood hedges and water fountains that refreshed the view. The plot is 3,346 m² in its entirety, facing two streets, and has an auxiliary construction that can be reconverted into an apartment, garage, etc. We are in front of the Real Club de Golf La Herrería, named after the forest that surrounds it, where in addition to the course we have a summer swimming pool with a large meadow and restaurant and tennis and paddle club. A few minutes walk away we reach the Monastery of El Escorial and the town center. This property is located at the foot of Mount Abantos, with stunning views and walks and surrounded by a wide variety of forest species in the numerous parks and surrounding hills and forests. History, monuments, architecture, nature and sports are attributes of this area, without forgetting gastronomy and culture, of which San Lorenzo prides itself through a wide range of high quality offerings. This village is singular and unique, located in a charismatic place, only 45 minutes from the center of Madrid, in the Sierra de Guadarrama, and with easy access by road.\\n\\nCan you imagine living here?
